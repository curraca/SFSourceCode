    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in Tricentis Software. The purpose of this letter is to summarize my understanding of our discussion and to determine the next steps for moving forward.

Business Goal

You told me that your goal is INPUT GOAL HERE.

Summary of Current Situation

Today nurses develop patient case plans at population or condition level, not on a patient level. Nurses determine risk with a manual process that is inaccurate so patients are not receiving adequate care or receiving too much. Patients readmit more frequently when social services aren&apos;t involved, post-discharge.

Capabilities Required / Potential Benefit

You feel you could reduce re-admissions by 10% if you had the following capabilities:

When planning at shift start, nurses and care managers could vie a risk-stratified list identifying patients at highest re-admissions risk and why, view all options on a monitor so plans can be developed on an individual basis for most effective patient care.

When patients are at risk of re-admission, your nurses/care managers could review suggested care plans on a monitor and select the most appropriate plan based on the patient&apos;s history and specific risk factors.
When discharging patients, nurses could identify high risk patients with no support network and match the patient to available social services displayed on a monitor, so the patient receives the most appropriate care post-discharge.

Next Steps

You expressed interest in further investigating Tricentis&apos;s products and services. I&apos;d like to propose the following next steps:

Confirm you are in agreement with the summary of our discussions.
Arrange Interviews with your COO and CIO, both of whom would be involved in the implementation of quality testing.

Summarize findings to the group and gain consensus for further evaluation of Tricentis&apos;s offerings.

I&apos;ll call Tuesday, April 9, at 8:30am to review this letter and discuss our next steps. I look forward to working with you.

Best,
