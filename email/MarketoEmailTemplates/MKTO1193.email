<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},<br /><br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read this email.
 My name is Martin and I work with the Marketing Consulting team at Tricentis (www.tricentis.com), a leading Test Automation provider with operations globally.<br /><br />Regarding the Avaloq system that you are using at Bank CIC (Version 2.7), we wanted to touch-base and provide a walk-through of 
our product, Tosca Testsuite (http://www.tricentis.com/tricentis-tosca-testsuite/).
 We have specifically designed an Avaloq extension to address the biggest challenges of testing your Avaloq system: Test data management, Risk coverage, and Test automation.
 <br /><br />Tosca Testsuite complements your Avaloq migration cycle, ensuring that the end-user testing challenges during extraction, mapping, transformation and data cleansing using Pl/SQL packages and SQL scripts are better managed.<br /><br />I would be happy to connect with you at a time and 
day of your choosing to explain more.
 We also can schedule a demo of our product&rsquo;s features and functionalities in context of the Avaloq system which you folks are currently using.
 Please do let me know.
 <br /><br />Have a great day and look forward to hearing from you.
 <br /></span></p>
