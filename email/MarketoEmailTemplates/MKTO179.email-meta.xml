    <subject>Personal Invitation – Tricentis Accelerate Roadshow</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;!-- --&gt; 

Hi {{lead.First Name}},

While software-powered business innovation and quality customer experiences have never been more important, the status quo of software testing is still slow, expensive, complex, and full of surprises and disconnected from business needs.  More and more companies are acknowledging that they need to test efficiently, effectively, and appropriately in order to accelerate innovation, and reduce cost and business risk.

Join us on the Tricentis Accelerate Roadshow, where we will focus on how to address these emerging challenges and approaches Global 2000 companies can take to deliver superior business results.

Michael Eckhoff, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales, will share our company vision and Wolfgang Platz, Founder &amp; Chief Product Officer will discuss the “Future of Business Innovation – An Industry Perspective” – where he will show the current challenges testing organizations face and how they leverage innovative new products from Tricentis to drive business results.

This will be followed by a roundtable, where you can share your thoughts and ideas and address critical issues in an interactive and informal peer-to-peer dialog
