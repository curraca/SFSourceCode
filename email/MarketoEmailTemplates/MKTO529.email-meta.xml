    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Thank you for dropping by our Tricentis booth at the EuroSTAR Conference in Dublin this November. It was a pleasure to meet you!

I would be happy to personally offer my assistance if you would like to learn more about Tricentis and our testing solutions. If you are interested I am also available to further discuss Tosca Testsuite and give you a personalized demo of the product.

Thanks for visiting our booth! I look forward to meeting you again soon.

With kind regards,
