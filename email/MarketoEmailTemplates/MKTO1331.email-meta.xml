Gartner Newsletter
Tricentis has recently publishing a newsletter in conjunction with Gartner on the topic of starting testing earlier in the development cycle with API Testing and Service Virtualization. The newsletter, “Better, Faster, Stronger: Adopting API Testing and Service Virtualization from the Start” discusses the importance of shifting left and speeding up the testing process in order to meet time to market demands. The newsletter also includes a complimentary Gartner research note, the “Market Guide for API Testing and Service Virtualization”. Download the newsletter here &lt;http://www.tricentis.com/resource-assets/better-faster-stronger-adopting-api-testing-and-service-virtualization-from-the-start/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=news_p&gt;!
