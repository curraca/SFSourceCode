    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name}},


Are you constantly asked to deliver increasingly more comprehensive test results in ever-decreasing and continuous cycle times? Do you agree that your testing relentlessly faces tight budget, time and resource constraints at the same time? Do you agree that all this just causes frustration for almost everyone involved? If yes, we should talk.

Join Dr. Gerd Weishaar, VP of Product Management at Tricentis, for visionary talk on DevOps.

Learn how to:



 - take these pain points and turn them into gains
 - achieve maximum risk coverage with a minimal number of powerful test cases
 - achieve high sustainable automation rates without any programming skills
