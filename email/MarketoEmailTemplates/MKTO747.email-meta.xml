    <subject>Testing Your Way to a Happy DevOps Marriage</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

The marriage of Development and Operations is not always a happy one. DevOp’s ability to produce perfect cycles of continuous integration is only as strong as its weakest link: Testing. Without the ability to test better - not harder - the DevOps marriage quickly falls apart.

Tricentis’ Tosca Testsuite gives you the tools for a successful DevOps relationship: allowing you to optimize your risk coverage, manage your test data, and automate your software testing efforts so your DevOps can thrive.

Best regards,

Vincent
