Hi {{lead.First Name}},

Software-powered business innovation has never been more essential to quality customer experiences. Yet software testing is still caught in the past: it is slow, expensive, complex, and disconnected from business needs. More and more companies are acknowledging the need to test efficiently, effectively, and appropriately to reduce cost and business risk.

Join us on the Tricentis Accelerate Roadshow, where we will focus on these emerging challenges in order to help Global 2000 companies develop approaches that deliver superior business results.

Michael Eckhoff, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales, will kick the event off with a Business Update. Wolfgang Platz, Founder &amp; Chief Product Officer, will discuss the “Future of Business Innovation – An Industry Perspective”, where he will examine the challenges testing organizations face and how they leverage the Tricentis approach to drive business results.

An informal, interactive roundtable and networking lunch will conclude the event.
