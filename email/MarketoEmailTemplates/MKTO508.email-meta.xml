    <textOnly>How to Plan your DevOps Journey

Hi {{lead.First Name}},

Web-based applications that demand continuous change while mitigating risk are often the best starting points for DevOps initiatives. In order to achieve continuous delivery and ensure the successful deployment of these applications the development and operations teams must not only communicate with one another, but also implement automation across the entire process chain, which is most apparent in software testing. Continuous integration becomes the glue between the agile development and operations teams. Together they are able to shorten time-to-market and deliver business value at unprecedented speeds.

The continuous integration tool chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and often the weakest link is test automation. Therefore it is crucial to choose a test automation tool that can achieve high automation rates and is robust against change. With years of experience in test automation, Tricentis helps companies to achieve up to 90+% test automation rates, thereby addressing growing demands for faster release times while optimizing their risk coverage.
