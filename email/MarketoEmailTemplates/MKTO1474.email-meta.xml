Highlighted features

The Tosca Recorder
Our new Tosca Recorder records and creates automated test cases in a flash! The best part of Tosca Testsuite is that it automatically recognizes previously-recorded controls and re-uses your test assets, meaning you always have redundancy-free test cases.

Distributed Execution
For Tosca Testsuite 9.0, Tricentis has developed a smart approach to distributed test execution, helping to boost the performance of your testing. It distributes your automated test sets across multiple virtual machines, computers in your network, or in the cloud. No need for complex installation or labor intensive configurations: we keep it simple, yet powerful.

Tosca Flow
Testing your project shouldn’t mean having to manually test every variable that may or may not be important to your company. For Tosca Testsuite 9.0 the Tricentis team has come up with an ingenious way of taking one of your test cases and automatically creating prioritized variants that are ready for testing.

OSV: Proxy + Weights
For the release of Tosca Testsuite 9.0, we’ve upgraded our Orchestrated Service Virtualization product by adding a proxy tool. This allows you to record the simulation and specify how third party services should react to your application.

API Automation: Database
Direct access to the database layer of your system enables you to peek under the hood of your applications and check how your data is stored in the persistency layer. Combine it with reusable test step blocks to enable also business testers to directly check database records.
