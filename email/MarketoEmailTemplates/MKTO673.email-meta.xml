    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

I want to tell you about GBST, a leading provider of securities transactions and fund administration software, who came to Tricentis looking for a solution to a problem. 

The need for a competitive edge kept GBST Shares’ software in a state of constant innovation. These required an overwhelming amount of regression testing, which, done manually, took over 535 hours of work.

Tricentis worked with GBST to leverage the Tosca Testsuite to optimize their risk coverage, manage their data, and automate their testing efforts across the company’s highly complex system environments.

The result?


 - Accelerated end-to-end testing time by 80%.
 - Reduced annual testing cost by 50%.
 - Reduced business risk by identifying bugs early in development.

If you want to hear how Tricentis’ Tosca Testsuite can help your company succeed, I am happy to speak further with you!
