Tricentis benefits

 - Model-Based Test Automation: Frequent and shorter test cycles combined with the high expectations of customers mean that enterprises can’t afford not to automate. Tosca Testsuite meets this challenge with a new approach to testing, Model-Based Test Automation. Tricentis customers regularly achieve automation rates of 90% or more of all test cases, results we call Extreme Automation.

- Minimize Risk: Sometimes teams don’t know what to test and respond by simply multiplying the number of test cases. Unfortunately, this slows down the testing process without actually increasing test coverage. Tosca Testsuite comes with the Risk Management Engine, enabling you to measure, manage and control risk coverage by prioritizing and executing tests based on business value. Never be in the dark about risk coverage again.  Tricentis clients achieve 95% or even higher risk coverage.

Non-technical staff are empowered to write manual and automated test cases in plain English so that you can distribute testing tasks across wider teams and allocate staffing according to your business strategy.
