<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},<br /><br />Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read this email.
 My name is Martin&nbsp;and I work with the Marketing Consulting team at Tricentis (www.tricentis.com), a leading Test Automation provider with operations globally.<br /><br />Regarding the Avaloq Banking System that Canaccord Genuity Limited implemented in early 2015, we wanted to touch-base and 
provide a walk-through of our product, Tosca Testsuite (http://www.tricentis.com/tricentis-tosca-testsuite/).
 We have specifically designed an Avaloq extension to address the biggest challenges of testing your Avaloq system: Test Data management, Risk coverage, and Test automation.
 <br /><br />Tosca Testsuite complements your Avaloq migration cycle, ensuring that the end-user testing challenges during extraction, mapping, transformation and data cleansing using Pl/SQL packages and SQL scripts are better managed.
 It also seamlessly links into Avaloq Scripting and Avaloq Report Writing, so that your overall time to manage this process is further reduced.<br /><br />I would be happy to connect with you at a time and day of your choosing to explain more.
 We also can schedule a demo of our product&rsquo;s features and functionalities in context of the Avaloq system which you folks are currently using.
 Please do let me know.
 <br /><br />Have a great day and look forward to hearing from you.
 <br /><br />Regards,<br />Martin Karolyi<br />Technical Advisor<br /><br /></span></p>
