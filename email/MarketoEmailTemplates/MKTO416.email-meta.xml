Hi {{lead.First Name}},

Needs Intro Paragraph

About the survey:

voke is an independent analyst firm and a champion of lifecycle virtualization. voke is conducting research about enterprise IT organizations and invites you to participate in a survey about service virtualization. This is voke’s fifth survey about using virtualization in the application lifecycle.

voke wants to hear your opinion about whether or not you use service virtualization. All responses are confidential and data will be used in the aggregate only.


 - Is your work delayed while waiting for applications, services, and components to be available?
 - Are you able to test early in the lifecycle or are you waiting for applications, services, and components to be fully complete before testing?
 - Have you gained productivity from using a service virtualization solution? 



Please tell us about your organization and whether or not you are using service virtualization in your application lifecycle.

Share your story to participate in this exciting research. After completing the survey, you will receive an offer to receive a free report based on this research.

You can access the survey by clicking here &lt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/FYSKGSF&gt;.
