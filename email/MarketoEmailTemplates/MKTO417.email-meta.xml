Tricentis Accelerate 2014

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Thank you for attending Accelerate 2014. It was our pleasure to meet you in beautiful Vienna and we look forward to your continued interest in all the various testing solutions.

Over 200 attendees, representing 57 companies from 12 countries, came together to participate in Tricentis’ Accelerate 2014. Participants were able to interact and discover new approaches to solving today’s biggest testing challenges that drive their success. The conference was an overwhelming success and we hope that you were able to take this opportunity to learn and network with all of our expert executives and researchers within the field.

In this year’s event, Agile was a clear focus topic for all our customers. Risk Coverage, Test Virtualization, Model-Based Test Automation and Mobile Testing were also key in many of the discussions. All of these topics have one thing in common: how to increase customer satisfaction and how Tosca Testsuite answers these new challenges.

If you felt like you missed something at the conference – don’t worry, we have it all recorded and documented here &lt;http://www.tricentis.com/about/events/tricentis-accelerate&gt;. Please check regularly, we will keep you updated by adding add new things about Accelerate 2014.

Thank you for your attention! We hope you all had a safe journey home! We look forward to seeing you next year at Tricentis Accelerate 2015!
