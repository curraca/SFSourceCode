    <textOnly>Webinar: Lessons Learned from Agile Testing

Hi {{lead.First Name}},

A constant fear during testing projects, is the inability to meet deadlines while ensuring quality and avoiding risk. In this webinar, Tricentis Co-Founder Wolfgang Platz and Tricentis Product Manager Ingo Philipp introduce a benchmark of best practices collected over the past years during several fast-paced software development projects. The webinar will address several key issues Tricentis has recently encountered from various testing projects, such as:

 - The need to continuously increase quality in terms of business risk, even in a turbulent environment
 - Meet demands of increased time-to-market by establishing a test case portfolio that is not only easy to understand and maintain, but also has a high degree of reusability and is able to react to changes instantaneously
 - The need to structure test case executions with quality measures, in order to save valuable testing time and create guaranteed risk-free safety net

Join the webinar to learn more about on-going testing issues from our best practices and how this can optimize your time and effort in any software development project.

We look forward to seeing you at our webinar.

Best regards,
 The Tricentis Webinar Team
