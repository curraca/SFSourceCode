    <textOnly>voke Service Virtualization Survey

Hi {{lead.First Name}},

The average enterprise landscape requires 33 connected systems to function as needed. The average tester usually only gets access to 18. It&apos;s often too complex and expensive to provide production-like testing infrastructure to testing teams. This is when Tricentis’ Tosca Testsuite Service Virtualization steps in.

Voke wants to hear your opinion about whether or not you use service virtualization. As an independent analyst firm and a champion of lifecycle virtualization, this is voke’s fifth survey about using virtualization in the application lifecycle. All responses are confidential and data will be used in the aggregate only.

 - Is your work delayed while waiting for applications, services, and components to be available?
 - Are you able to test early in the lifecycle or are you waiting for applications, services, and components to be fully complete before testing?
 - Have you gained productivity from using a service virtualization solution? 

You can access the survey by clicking here &lt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/FYSKGSF&gt;.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out voke’s survey. Following the completion of the survey, you will have the opportunity to receive a free report, based on this research. Tricentis is continually working towards improving global testing solutions; your feedback will help achieve this.

Best regards,
