Hi {{lead.First Name}},

We hope you enjoyed your visit to sunny Orlando and the Agile 2014 conference.  Thank you for stopping by the Tricentis booth to learn more about our industry leading, script-less functional test automation solution, Tosca Testsuite. As a tool vendor, it is easy to miss the context of the first principle of the Agile Manifesto, &quot;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.&quot;  Here are Tricentis though, we&apos;ve been building our tool using iterative design from day 1, way back in 2007.  We&apos;ve learned that a tool that helps team focus on delivering quality software, faster, with less rework and reduced maintenance fits right in with Agile practices.

We have just announced an Agile Testing Webinar Series that kicks off on Thursday, August 14 at 12:30 ET with Diego Lo Giudice, Vice President and Principal Analyst from Forrester Research sharing his thoughts on Testing at the Speed of Agile. You can find more information and register at http://innovate.tricentis.com/webinar-agile-series-1-us.html.

In the interim, if there is anything we can do to help you break away from the trap of maintaining scripts, or help your teams realize the value of over 90% test automation, feel free to give me a call.

Best Regards,


Michael Eckhoff
