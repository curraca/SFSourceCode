Hi {{lead.First Name}},

In order to survive in today&apos;s market, companies need to stay competitive by developing applications at a rapid pace. This means that agile development teams must deal with faster product cycles and shorter time to market. As a result, companies are looking towards API testing and service virtualization to speed up processes and are shifting testing to the left of their product cycle. By doing so, enterprises are able to provide complex business functionality, delivered at a faster pace with a quality that ensures a positive customer experience.
