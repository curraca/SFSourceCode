SAP Impact Analysis
Avoid the headache of implementing SAP packages. Tosca helps you to identify requirements as well as test cases which may be affected by any SAP support package upgrade, service pack or enhancement.

Test Case Design Relations
We’ve made designing test cases less tedious and stressful – yet again. This novel concept allows you to define distinct types of dependencies expressed as relations between attributes/instances which are then considered in linear expansion. Less maintenance effort and no manual clean-up!

X-Scan: Select on Screen
No need to worry about scanning complicated applications, our X-Scan has been enhanced to easily identify controls. The new Select on Screen tools helps you to choose controls directly in your application, making test automation effortless and intuitive.

Tosca Continuous Integration
Tosca CI seamlessly integrates your tests into your CI tool chain. Just select which tests to execute and manage everything through your CI environment. Tosca feeds all the results back into the CI tool to enable continuous feedback.
