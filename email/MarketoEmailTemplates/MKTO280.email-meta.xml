    <subject>T2S is scheduled to go live in 2015. Are you on track for this launch date?</subject>
    <textOnly>Are you ready for T2S?

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}} {{lead.Last Name:default=edit me}},

As you already know, Target 2 Securities (T2S) is one of the largest ongoing infrastructure projects in Europe’s financial industry. Developed and operated by the Eurosystem, it will bring substantial benefits to the European securities post-trading industry by providing a single pan-European platform for securities settlement.

Tricentis developed the T2S Simulator in cooperation with the leading European suppliers of post-trading services. It can simulate the full business behavior and elementary business messaging functionality of the T2S platform based on user-predefined business scenarios.

 - The T2S Simulator is a standalone application that simulates message-based interactions.
 - Save time and speed time to market by testing internally before the ECB’s platform is available. Work independently from the Eurosystem.
 - Use the T2S Simulator for regression testing not only during the T2S migration phase, but also for releases that come after the initial launch of T2S.
 - Limit the manual workload for testers during the various test execution phases.
 - Ensure adequate risk coverage and test efficiency, particularly during multiple repetitions of regression tests.

To learn more about the Tricentis T2S Simulator, please download the T2S Simulator Info Sheet &lt;http://www.tricentis.com/sites/default/files/pdf/about/T2S_Simulator_Fact_Sheet.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=internal&gt;.

I will be in Brussels from June 11-12 and would be happy to meet you in person to discuss the benefits of the Tricentis T2S Simulator in greater detail.
 I will contact you shortly to set up an appointment.

In the meantime, if you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at k.werner@tricentis.com &lt;mailto:k.werner@tricentis.com&gt;.

Sincerely,

Karl Werner
 Vice President EMEA Sales, Tricentis
