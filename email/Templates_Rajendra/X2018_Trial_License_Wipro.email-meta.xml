    <textOnly>Hello {!NullValue(Contact.FirstName, &quot;Sir or Madam&quot;)},


Thank you for your interest in Tricentis Tosca.

I received notification that you recently requested a trial license. Can I answer any questions for you about Tricentis or Tosca? By way of introduction, my name is Rajendra Mehrotra and I am the Alliance Manager, exclusively supporting Global Service Integrators. In my role, I work with key stakeholders to develop an effective GSI strategy that&apos;s mutually beneficial to both organizations.

As a note, Tricentis is a strategic Wipro partner with joint customers in all 3 regions with several new joint customers expected in the next 60 days. Wipro also has a Tosca COE in Bengaluru and over 900 trained and certified Tosca Users. In order to help you in your Tosca journey, I&apos;ve added a few items &amp; links that will help you understand some of what we do as well as added a new document that discusses Tosca position within Gartner&apos;s Magic Quadrant.
