    <subject>Enquiry for Flood IO</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!NullValue(Contact.FirstName, &quot;Sir or Madam&quot;)},


Thank you for your interest in Tricentis Tosca.

I received notification that you recently registered for Tricentis Tosca Load Testing webinar. As you may be aware that Tricentis has acquired Flood IO, industry&apos;s most flexible and scalable on-demand load testing solution. Flood IO helps teams &quot;shift left&quot; performance testing, enabling them to test how their applications scale with massive load generated from around the world.

As you probably know, Tricentis focuses on transforming traditional testing to meet the needs of Agile and DevOps processes. This acquisition broadens that mission to embrace load and performance testing. &quot;Continuous Load Testing&quot; exposes performance-related risks within the delivery pipeline - ensuring that rapid software releases don&apos;t compromise the end user experience.

Lastly, here are a couple links to more information about Flood IO -
