{!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you are well.  

My name is Hank Joyce and I am the Director of Major Accounts for Tricentis.      

I called you today to let you know that your previous representative, Andy Vogt, has recently left our company. 

Our management has asked me to step in and work with {!Account.Name} moving forward.   

Let me know a time when we could have a quick call this week. 

Sincerely,
