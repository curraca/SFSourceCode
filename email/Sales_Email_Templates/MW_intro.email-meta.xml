    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I am the Regional Manager for Tricentis.  We provide a functional test management and test automation software solution.  Our software, Tosca Testsuite, helps customers achieve 80-90% automation by eliminating the need for scripting.  The solution we have is application agnostic, absolutely zero scripting and provides a model based approach in line with the Agile and DevOps methodology.  Some of our customer are; BMW, Standard &amp; Poors, AMEX, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Siemensâ€¦etc.  

We will enhance QA by doing the following:  
1. Optimizing and building the right test cases 
2. Running tests early and often  
3. Integrating into any tool (open API) and making it repeatable  
4. Enabling non technical testers to build and maintain interchangeable manual and automated test cases  

Testing is time consuming and expensive, we have a better way.  Our subscription based licensing option makes the value proposition very compelling.  Do you have time in the next 2 weeks to discuss the Tosca Testsuite and how we are disrupting the testing market?  

Thank you for the consideration.</textOnly>
