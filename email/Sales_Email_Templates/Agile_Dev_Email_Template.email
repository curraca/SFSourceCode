Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

I realize its fairly late, but thought I'd reach out regarding Test Automation in an Agile environment. Besides yourself, I've seen a few of your QA/Tester colleagues, from {!Lead.Company}, download and attend a few of our webinars on "Testing in an Agile Environment". 

Was hoping that you may be able fill me in on the state of test automation at {!Lead.Company}. I assume there is a solution in place, but was wondering if there is concern with how your current solution is handling Agile Dev testing. 

Let me know if you'd be interested in learning more about our Model-Based testing approach and how we may be able to benefit {!Lead.Company}. Hope to hear back {!Lead.FirstName}. Thanks!
