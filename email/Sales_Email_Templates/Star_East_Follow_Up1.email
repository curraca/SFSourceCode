Hello {!Lead.FirstName},

I know its late on a Tuesday, so hopefully this finds its way to you. Just wanted to quickly touch base following the Conference last month. Thank you for stopping by the Tricentis booth.

I'm sure you had stopped by quite a few booths at the conference and wanted to cover my bases and make sure that isn't anything further I could do for you. As a refresh, Tricentis specializes in Test Automation and is recognized as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for our approach to Software Testing. 

As the {!Lead.Title}, are you aware of any initiatives or even basic interest in Test Automation? If so, I'd like to set up a call with my team to go over your needs. I realize that June is extremely busy for a lot of people, so would you have time for a call in early July, week of the 11th? Looking forward to your response back. Thanks!
