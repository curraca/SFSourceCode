    <subject>Cleanup needed on Opportunities in Stage 0</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Sales Rep,

this is a kind reminder, that you have the following opportunities in Stage 0 for more than 3 days now. Please switch them to Stage 1 (Discovering/Identifying) immediately to indicate you accept the opportunity. After you have done an initial qualification either propagate it to Stage 2 (Qualification) or Close it out as appropriate. If the opportunity is wrongly assigned to you, please contact SalesOps@tricentis.com.</textOnly>
