    <subject>Attention please - upcoming Close Dates</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Sales Rep,

the following of your opportunities have a close date within the next 7 days. Please closely monitor the accuracy of the close dates. This notice should allow you to be proactive about your forecast accuracy (ie. to avoid close dates slipping to the ‘past’, if PO doesn’t arrive as expected). If you have any questions please contact a member of the Sales Operations team. Thank you.</textOnly>
